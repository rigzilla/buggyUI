This is a script to make prop rigging and animation in maya easier

In order for this script to work, create a folder called "tmp" on your C:\ harddrive (this is where transformation data will be stored in).
Then save the script to your maya script path (default is: C:\Users\Student\Documents\maya\(your version)\scripts).
To bring up the UI, run:

import buggyUI
reload (buggyUI)
buggyUI.BuggyUI()

from the script editor in a python tab, and create a shelf button, if you want.


this script brings up a UI, that can be used to make simple prop rigging and animation more efficient
it was originally created for a specific file (buggy by David Schneider), but can also be used for other maya scenes as well
